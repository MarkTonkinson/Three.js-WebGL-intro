====================

Intro to Three.js/WebGL

Welcome to the world of WebGL & Three.js! 

WebGL is now supported in all major browsers and mobile support is increasing thus making it an excellent choice for developing games, visualizations & cool effects. 


* Install the workshopper: npm install -g introtowebgl
* Workshop github: https://github.com/alexmackey/IntroToWebGLWithThreeJS
* Run introtowebgl from command line and follow the instructions
* Play, have fun. See whats possible!

These exercises will introduce you to many of the basics you need to put together something more complex (and interesting!).

By the end of this workshop you will understand the following:

  * Three.js coordinate system
  * Primitives such as lighting & materials
  * How to move the camera and objects
  * How to resize and rotate objects
  * How to load a textured 3d model
  * How to detect mouse clicks on an object


In the assets folder you will find 3 other folders:

  * Boilerplate App - All three.js scenes require a bit of setup - a scene, camera, lighting & rendering loop. This app sets up a simple scene and is a good template to use for the exercises
  * Boilerplate physics - this setups a simple scene & the physics engine physijs (exercise 7)
  * Goose model - a textured 3d model Goose (exercise 5)
  * Game example - simple balancing game using physisjs physics engine
